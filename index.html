Here are some of the most famous Martin Luther King Jr. quotes:
<p>
  <ul>

<p> “I Have a Dream” <br> <br>
  “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.”
<br><br>
“Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.”
<br><br>
“The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.”
<br><br>
“Freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed.”
<br><br>
“The time is always right to do what is right.”
<br><br>
"True peace is not merely the absence of tension; it is the presence of justice."
<br><br>
“Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter.”
<br><br>

“Faith is taking the first step even when you don't see the whole staircase.”
<br><br>
“In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends.”
<br><br>
"I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word in reality. This is why right, temporarily defeated, is stronger than evil triumphant."
<br><br>
“I have decided to stick with love. Hate is too great a burden to bear.”
<br><br>
“Be a bush if you can't be a tree. If you can't be a highway, just be a trail. If you can't be a sun, be a star. For it isn't by size that you win or fail. Be the best of whatever you are.”
<br><br>
“Life's most persistent and urgent question is, 'What are you doing for others?’”</p>
